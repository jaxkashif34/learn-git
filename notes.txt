************Git for Professionals notes**************
1) Its is a bad thing to change multiple files and push them into remote
2) the smaller the change in git the better it is for future ourselves and other colleagues
3) we can also add some changed part of file into commit and leave the rest part of the 
change for future commit


************Meaning of vertical lines in gutter section**************

so If you notice that on the left hand side of the current opened file in the gutter 
section (right side of line numbers) you can possible see three different colored vertical lines
if line if green its means that new line is add which is not in last commit
if line is shaded blue its means that line is modified
if you see a red > arrow head its mean line is remove which is in last commit
(you can test it by doing your self)

************Inline View Changes**************

we can also see the inline view changes by going into version control icon -> 
(the file you want to see the changes) -> click on three horizontal dots top right side
-> inline View

************Git Amend (git commit --amend) (something I want to add in the last commit)**************

this is for if we want to add a code that we want to add in the previous or last commit 
but we commit the changes then git amend is used

(TEST text I'm adding to test the git commit --amend)


************Undo Last Commit (git update-ref)**************
there might be a time you commit accidentally or too early and you want to undo it
(TEST line I'm adding too early and commit it also to test the git update-ref with vs code)
(SCI = Source Control Icon), (HD = Horizontal Dots)
SCI -> HD -> commit -> undo last commit


************Rollback to Previous Commit (git update-ref)**************

if we commit several times and want to revert the several commits earlier then we use it

now I'm will add three commits to test how rollback works in vs code
TEST 1st commit
